# TwitchBot

This .NET Core Console Application provides and IRC-based chat bot for [Twitch](https://twitch.tv).
This is currently a work in progress.

I do not intend to make this a user friendly application.
I'm working on this to perform some very specific bot functions for my twitch stream and the streams I moderate.
I'm also writing this to get more practice with service collections, dependency injection, logging, configuration, and multi-threading.
That is why the project may look overly complex for what it does.

That being said, I am trying to keep this project extensible enough that others could re-use the code.
At the very least, if you are interested i a multi-threaded service-based twitch chat bot, this projcet should be useful.
